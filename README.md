# npuzzle

This is a 42 curriculum project oriented around A* and relvant heuristics.

The goal is to find solution to given [N-puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) (*[Taquin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeu_de_taquin)* in French) state.

## Notes / Todo
### A*
- [ ] Standard A* (subject)
    - [ ] uniform-cost 
    - [ ] greedy (bonus)
- [ ] Research if IDA* would have any performance improvements
- [ ] Wighted A* - explore
- [ ] Bidirectional A*
- [ ] parallel compute - explore


### Heuristics
- [ ] Manhattan distance
- [ ] Hamming distance

### Others
- [ ] benchmarks
- [ ] stats
- [ ] parity check for solvability - explore

### Bonuses
- [ ] different types of solution other than the snail one
